## ROCm GPU Server Driver Installation Guide for Linux 

### Introduction 
The ROCm Platform brings a rich foundation to advanced computing by seamlessly integrating the CPU and GPU with the goal of solving real-world problems.

On April 25th, 2016, we delivered ROCm 1.0 built around three pillars:

Open Heterogeneous Computing Platform (Linux(R) Driver and Runtime Stack), optimized for HPC & Ultra-scale class computing;

ROCm for the first time give you developer choice of programing languges on a AMD Radeon GPU computing platform.  We continue to support OpenCL with richer foundation which lets you more direct access to hardware. From here we bring Heterogeneous C and C++ Single Source Compiler, to approach computation holistically, on a system level, rather than as a discrete GPU artifact.  We also know there is need for focused  C++ Kernel language with C runtime to bring simpler path to bring your investment in CUDA based application, libraries and frameworks to AMDGPU Platform. We do this with our new HIP programing foundation.  ROCm is solid foundation that acknowledges the need for freedom of choice when it comes to platforms and APIs for GPU computing.

Using our knowledge of the HSA Standards and, more importantly, the HSA Runtime, we have been able to successfully extended support to the dGPU with critical features for accelerating NUMA computation. 
As a result, the ROCK driver is composed of several components based on our efforts to develop the Heterogeneous System Architecture for APUs, including the new AMDGPU driver, the Kernel Fusion Driver (KFD), 
the HSA+ Runtime and an LLVM based compilation stack which provides support for key languages. 

This support starts with AMDâ€™s FIJI Family of dGPUs. ROCm 1.3 further extends support to include the Polaris Family of ASICs. With ROCm 1.6 we add Vega Family of products. 

### System Requirements 

To use ROCm on your system you need the following: 
* ROCm Capable CPU and GPU 
	* PCIe Gen 3 Enabled CPU with PCIe Platform Atomics 
	* ROCm enabled GPU's 
		* Radeon Instinct Family MI25, MI8, MI6 
		* Radeon Vega Frontier Edition 
* Supported Version of Linux with a specified GCC Compiler and ToolChain 


Table 1. Native Linux Distribution Support in ROCm  1.6
Distribution	Kernel	GCC		GLIBC		
x86_64
Fedora 23		4.9		5.40	2.23		
Ubuntu 16.04	4.9		5.40	2.23		
	
### Pre Install Directions 

Verify You Have ROCm Capable GPU Installed int the System 
$ lspci | grep -i AMD

Verify You Have a Supported Version of Linux 
$ uname - m && cat /etc/*release

You will see some thing like for Ubuntu 
x86_64
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS"

Verify version of GCC 
$ gcc --version 
You will see 
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609 

### Choose an Installation Method

Package manager Based Install 
A Package Manager Based Installation use your Linux Distro system's package management service.  
Ubuntu uses Debian  and Fedora RPM Packages

* Ubuntu 
* Fedora 

#### Ubuntu Install 

##### Add the Repo Server
For Debian based systems, like Ubuntu, configure the Debian ROCm repository as
follows:

```shell
wget -qO - http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list'
```
The gpg key might change, so it may need to be updated when installing a new 
release. The current rocm.gpg.key is not avialable in a standard key ring distribution,
but has the following sha1sum hash:

f0d739836a9094004b0a39058d046349aacc1178  rocm.gpg.key

##### Install or update ROCm 

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rocm rocm-opencl-dev
```

Then, make the ROCm kernel your default kernel. If using grub2 as your bootloader, you can edit the GRUB_DEFAULT variable in the following file:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
set the GRUB_Default 
Edit: GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 4.9.0-kfd-compute-rocm-rel-1.6-77"
```shell
sudo update-grub
```
------------------------------------

#### Fedora Install 
Use the  dnf (yum) repository for installation of rpm packages.
To configure a system to use the ROCm rpm directory create the file
/etc/yum.repos.d/rocm.repo with the following contents:

```shell
[remote]

name=ROCm Repo

baseurl=http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/yum/rpm/

enabled=1

gpgcheck=0
```

Execute the following commands:
```shell
sudo dnf clean all
sudo dnf install rocm rocm-opencl-dev
```
Just like Ubuntu installs, the ROCm kernel must be the default kernel used at boot time.

Post Install Manual installation steps for Fedora to support HCC compiler 

A fully functional Fedora installation requires a few manual steps to properly 
setup, including:
 * [Building compatible libc++ and libc++abi libraries for Fedora](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/hcc/wiki#fedora)



##### Post install verification 

Verify you have the correct Kernel Post install 

```shell
$ uname -r
4.9.0-kfd-compute-rocm-rel-1.6-77
```

Test the driver is installed correctly 
```shell
cd /opt/rocm/hsa/sample
make
./vector_copy
```
Test if OpenCL is working based on default ROCm OpenCL include and library locations:
```shell
g++ -I /opt/rocm/opencl/include/ ./HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld -L/opt/rocm/opencl/lib/x86_64 -lOpenCL
```

Run it:
```shell
./HelloWorld
```

### To Uninstall the a Package 
* Ubuntu 
```shell
sudo apt-get purge libhsakmt
sudo apt-get purge radeon-firmware
sudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l | grep 'kfd\|rocm' | grep linux | grep -v libc | awk '{print $2}')
```
* Fedora 
```shell
sudo dnf remove ROCm   
```	

### Installing development packages for cross compilation

It is often useful to develop and test on different systems. In this scenario, you may prefer to avoid installing the ROCm Kernel to your development system.

In this case, install the development subset of packages:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rocm-dev
```
