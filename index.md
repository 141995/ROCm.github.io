title: ROCm, a new era in GPU Computing
---

## Welcome to the ROCm Platform

We are excited to present ROCm, the first open-source
HPC/ultrascale-class platform for GPU computing thatâ€™s also
programming-language independent. We are bringing the UNIX philosophy
of choice, minimalism and modular software development to GPU
computing. The new ROCm foundation lets you choose or even develop
tools and a language run time for your application.</p>

**ROCm is built for scale**; it supports multi-GPU
computing in and out of server-node communication through RDMA. It
also focuses on simplifying the stack when the driver directly
incorporates RDMA peer-sync support.

**ROCm has a rich system run time** with the critical
features that large-scale application, compiler and language-run-time
development requires.


### Going to 11, amping up the programming language runtime foundation.


ROCr System Runtime is language independet system runtime which
heavly leverages Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Runtime API.
This gives rich foundation to exectute programing language like HCC
C++ and HIP, Khronos Group OpenCL, Continum IO Anaconda Python

 * Multi-GPU coarse-grain shared virtual memory
 * Process concurrency and preemption
 * Large memory allocations
 * HSA signals and atomics
 * User-mode queues and DMA
 * Standardized loader and code-object format
 * Dynamics and offline-compilation support
 * Peer-to-Peer multi-GPU operation with RDMA support
 * Profiler trace and event-collection API
 * Systems-management API and tools


### Solid Compilation Foundation and Language Support

 *  LLVM compiler foundation
 *  HCC C++  and HIP for application portability
 *  GCN assembler and disassembler

The frontiers of what you can accomplish with ROCm are vast and
uncharted. We look forward to working with you to improve the platform
so you can use it more effectively in your own projects. Our efforts
have opened the door to unique heterogeneous-computing applications
that explore what this growing technology can do.
