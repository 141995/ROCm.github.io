If you are here, you will probably know ROCm provides a rich parallel computation foundation with the support of a diverse set of high-level programming languages (C, C++, OpenCL, Python, etc.) creating a solid foundation for heterogeneous computing.

### Your ready to contribute but you are not sure how to get involved, then this page will help.

One of biggest contributions you can give is reporting issues, please use our [bug reporting guide](contributing.md#bug-reports). Thanks in advance!
