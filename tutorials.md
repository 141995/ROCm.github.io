# ROCm Tutorials
ROCm comes with a set of tutorials designed to help you understand how you can use and extend the platform.

* [Vector-Add](https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Tools/HIP-Examples/tree/master/vectorAdd) Vector Add in HIP
* [Mini N-body](https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Tools/HIP-Examples/tree/master/mini-nbody)
This sample demonstrates the use of the HIP API for a mini n-body problem.
* [Assembly Sample](GCN_asm_tutorial.html) The Art of AMDGCN Assembly:How to Bend the Machine to Your Will.  This tutorial demonstrates GCN assembly with ROCm application development.
* [Optimizing Dispatches](optimize_dispatch.html) ROCm With Rapid Harmony: Optimizing HSA Dispatch: This tutorial shows how to optimize HSA dispatch performance for ROCm application development.
* [CLOC Offline Compiler](rocncloc.html) ROCm With Harmony: Combining OpenCL Kernels, HCC and HSA in a Single Program. This tutorial demonstrates how to compile OpenCL kernels using the CL offline compiler (CLOC) and integrate them with HCC C++ compiled ROCm applications.
